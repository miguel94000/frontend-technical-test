### Have you met issues that you left on the side to finish in time and how would you solve them?

Answer:

I have encountered two major problems. The css and the infinite scroll.

The Mui createTheme is very capricious for the variants. To overcome this problem I used directly objects that are called in the "sx" attribute of MUI components.

For the inifini scroll, I wanted to add a condition in case the api would arrive at the end of the message list. But I was missing an endpoint to be able to manage this better. I prefered to revise my function and stay on the essential infinite scroll
